# Credit Card Fraud Detection
For any bank or financial institution, fraud detection using credit cards is a priority. We must detect possible fraud so that consumers will not be able to charge items that they have not purchased. The goal is therefore to create a classifier that informs us if a requested transaction is a fraud.

In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions using machine numpy, scikit learn, and few other python libraries. We overcome the problem by creating a binary classifier and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to see which fits better.
